# vagrant-darwin-smb plugin
This plugin provides capability to add SMB synced folders to Darwin (OS X) guests. It is a simple wrapper/proxy to [mount_smbfs](http://linux.die.net/man/8/smbmount) command.

## Installation
    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-darwin-smb

## Usage
Define SMB synced folders in your Vagrantfile as usual. It should just work. If you need custom options you can pass an array of strings as `mount_options` parameter.

## Caveats
Currently, there is no ability to pass -f, -d or -N parameters to mount_smbfs. 

## Acknowledgments
This plugin steals shamelessly from core Vagrant Darwin NFS and Linux SMB capabilities. All credit goes to Vagrant guys.
